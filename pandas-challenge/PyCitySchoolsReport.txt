PyCitySchools Report

This collection of data shows data is taken from 15 different schools, showing student 
grades in math and reading along with the school budget.

Cabrera High School is the highest scoring Charter school, while Bailey and Figeroa High School have the highest scoring students in reading and math.

The schools with the highest budget appear to have the most students passing by overall percentage and by math and reading scores combined.

These top schools also have the most students so this might not be a clear comparison of schools.
